# Haruki Inbox
A sleek and modern skin for Thunderbird.

## What is Haruki Inbox?
Haruki Inbox (or Haruki, for short) is a skin made for [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) that
brings modern and polished aesthetics. It also shares some of [Natsumi
Browser](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser)'s design language, so if you're familiar with
Natsumi, you'll be familiar with Haruki.

Just like Natsumi, Haruki is NOT a standalone email client.
